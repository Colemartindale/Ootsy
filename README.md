[Ootsy](https://ootsy.herokuapp.com/#/) is a single-page fullstack replica of Etsy, that features product listings of all kinds from various shops. Ootsy allows users to create and save account information as well as browse products and categories to find what suits them. Also, Ootsy lets users who have an account leave reviews on products with delete and edit review functionality. 

With PostgresSQL as a database and Rails as a backend, Ootsy is able to store user credentials, reviews, listing information, and AWS (S3) photo URLs successfully. ReactJS and ReduxJS were implemented as frontend in order to create a seemless single-page application. For UI and visuals, SCSS was used to facilitate a smooth user experience.

The header includes a navigation bar with search functionality that looks up items by keywords and eight different links that take the user to unique category pages. A sign-in/sign-up modal is in the nav bar as well that enables users to leave reviews.
